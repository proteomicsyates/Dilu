# Dilu - a tool for metabolomics data analysis

![Dilu](http://sequest.scripps.edu/ygao/dilu.png)

Dilu (named after the legendary horse in ancient China, means black horse with white) is a novel platform for high-resolution metabolomics data quantification and identification. Dilu takes advantage of the high-resolution MS and MS/MS data generated by modern instruments to perform robust and accurate quantification without the need for retention time correction. Dilu allows users to define ‘expert rules’ for in silico fragmentation and therefore improves the overall performance of metabolite identification. 



# Example file
Use dilu_main_gui to add all the liver MSn file to group1 and all the brain MSn to group2
Then add to queue
Then run queue
